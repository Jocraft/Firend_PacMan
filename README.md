# Pacman Game

Welcome to the Pacman Game! This is a fun project where Pacman has been reimagined with a personalized twist, featuring the face of my friend as the protagonist.

## About the Project

This project is a recreation of the classic Pacman game with a humorous and personal touch. Developed as a lighthearted side project, it incorporates custom sprites and fun interactions while keeping the essence of the original game alive.

## Building the Executable

To create a standalone executable file:

   ```
2. Run the following command to create a one-file executable with an icon:
